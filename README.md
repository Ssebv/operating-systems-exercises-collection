## Projects

1. **basic-c**: A simple C program with basic functionality.
2. **c-client-server-listfiles**: A client-server program where the client requests a list of files from the server's directory.
3. **client-server-sample**: A basic client-server program showcasing communication between the two.
4. **concurrent-programming**: A multi-threaded program using pthreads to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
5. **file-transfer-client-server**: A file transfer application allowing clients to upload and download files from the server.
6. **inc-signals-game**: A game utilizing signals for inter-process communication.
7. **signal-communication**: An example of signal communication between processes.
